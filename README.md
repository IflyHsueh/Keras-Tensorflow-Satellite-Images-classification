# Image-classification-using-keras
National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) collects satellite imagery data across the whole of
the Continental United States. An average image is 6000x7000 pixels have size of about 200MB
each. The entire dataset is approx. 65 TeraBytes. Sample image dataset taken from the entire
65TB of data includes numerous landscapes like rural areas, urban areas, mountains, forest
patches, rivers, lakes farms, etc. covering the entire state of California. NAIP developed an
image labeling tool to uniformly label image patches belonging to a specific landmass. However,
the labelling by this tool was performed manually which consumed high manpower and labor
cost. This project aims to analyze the dataset using neural networks to classify the images into
either of following â€“ barren land, forest, grassland and others.

## Problem Statement
Bulid a deep leaning model to classify the images taken from satellite into the following categories:
   -  Barren Land
   -  Forest
   -  Grassland
   -  Others
